# Stock Sentiment Analysis using News Headlines

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.

In today's communications and news consumption, the headlines of various articles play an even more important role than before. Now, we use sentiment analysis on these headlines on a particular company or companies to determine the effects of the headlines to the stock market.
